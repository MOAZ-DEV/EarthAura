Life flourished among tall trees and bright wildflowers in a forest bathed in sunlight. However, as summer progressed, the ground crackled beneath our feet and the air became drier. A tiny fire was started by a bolt of lightning one fateful afternoon, and it swiftly grew due to the wind and the underbrush in the forest. 
The residents had to leave as the animals escaped and the flames blazed, destroying everything in their path. Firefighters came together in the midst of the confusion and bravely and determinedly attacked the fire. 
The landscape was scarred but not destroyed when the smoke cleared. The ashes gave way to new vegetation as nature started to recover. Once afraid, the community changed its strategy, adopting firebreaks and controlled burns to reduce the risk. Together, they learnt that flames, while terrible, could also spark regeneration and resilience in the heart of the forest.
